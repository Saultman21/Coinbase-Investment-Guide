Part 1: Understanding Cryptocurrency Basics
What Is Cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency is digital money you can use online without a bank. It’s stored on a blockchain, a secure digital ledger that records every transaction, like a tamper-proof notebook. You don’t need to understand the tech—just know crypto lets you:

Buy things (some stores accept Bitcoin).
Invest (like stocks, hoping the value grows).
Send money globally (like PayPal, but no middleman).

Popular cryptocurrencies include:

Bitcoin (BTC): The original crypto, like digital gold, known for its stability and fame.
Ethereum (ETH): Powers apps and other cryptocurrencies, great for growth.
USDC: A “stablecoin” always worth $1, perfect for beginners to avoid price swings.
Tether (USDT): Another stablecoin, similar to USDC.
Dogecoin (DOGE): A fun, meme-based coin with a loyal community.

Why Try Crypto?

Low Entry: Start with $10, no big commitment.
Growth Potential: Bitcoin was $1 in 2011, now thousands! Small investments can grow.
Control: You own your crypto, not a bank or government.
Learning: Coinbase makes it fun with free crypto rewards for studying.

Risks to Understand
Crypto has risks:

Price Volatility: Your $10 could drop to $5 or rise to $20. Only invest what you can lose.
Scams: Fake websites and messages trick people. Stick to Coinbase’s official app/site.
Tech Errors: Sending crypto to the wrong address means it’s gone forever.
Regulation: Laws may change, affecting crypto use.

We’ll cover safety tips to keep you protected.

Part 2: Why Choose Coinbase?
Coinbase is a top crypto platform, ideal for beginners. Here’s why:

Simple Interface: The app is like online banking, with clear buttons and guides.
Trusted: Used by millions, regulated in the U.S., and a public company (stock: COIN).
Secure: Bank-level security, including encryption and offline storage.
Learn and Earn: Get free crypto for watching videos.
Low Start: Buy crypto with just $10.
Features: Buy, sell, track prices, set alerts, automate investments, and more.
Support: 24/7 help via chat or email.

Coinbase is perfect for all ages, especially older users who want an easy, safe way to start.

Part 3: Step-by-Step Guide to Using Coinbase
Step 1: Sign Up for Coinbase

Get the App:
On your phone, open the App Store (iPhone) or Google Play (Android).
Search “Coinbase” and install the official app (blue logo with a white “C”).
Or, on a computer, go to https://advanced.coinbase.com/join/US678RB.


Use My Referral Link:
Sign up with https://advanced.coinbase.com/join/US678RB. It’s free, and we both get a bonus if you buy $100+ later!


Create an Account:
Open the app or website, tap “Sign Up.”
Enter your email (use one you check regularly, e.g., Gmail or Yahoo).
Create a strong password (8+ characters, mix letters, numbers, symbols, e.g., “BlueSky2025#”). Save it in a notebook or password manager (like LastPass, 1Password, or your phone’s notes app).
Check the box to agree to Coinbase’s terms and privacy policy.
Tap “Create Account.”


Verify Your Email:
Check your email (including spam/junk) for a message from Coinbase.
Click the link to confirm your email address.
If you don’t see it, tap “Resend Email” in the app or wait 5 minutes.



Step 2: Set Up Your Account

Enter Personal Info:
Log in with your email and password.
Enter your full legal name (as on your ID) and date of birth. Coinbase needs this to comply with U.S. laws.
Provide your address (street, city, state, ZIP code). This is private and used for verification.


Verify Your Identity:
Coinbase requires ID to prevent fraud and follow regulations.
In the app, go to “Settings” > “Identity Verification” (or follow the prompt after signing up).
Choose your ID type: driver’s license, passport, or state ID.
Select “Take Photo” or “Upload Photo”:
Phone: Use your phone’s camera. Ensure good lighting, no glare, and hold the ID steady. Take front and back photos as prompted.
Computer: Upload saved photos or use a webcam.


You may need a selfie to confirm it’s you. Follow the app’s instructions (e.g., “Smile” or “Turn head left”).
Verification takes 5–10 minutes. Coinbase emails you when approved.
If rejected, check your photos for clarity or contact support via “Settings” > “Help.”


Link a Payment Method:
To buy crypto, add a way to pay.
Go to “Settings” > “Payment Methods” > “Add a Payment Method.”
Options:
Bank Account: Lowest fees (free deposits, ~1% for withdrawals). Find your account and routing numbers on a check or in your bank’s app/website. Linking takes 1–5 days (Coinbase sends two small test deposits to verify).
Debit Card: Instant buys, but 3–4% fees. Enter card number, expiration, CVV (3 digits on back).
Credit Card: Instant, but some banks block crypto purchases. Check with your bank first.
PayPal: Quick deposits (if available). Log in to PayPal to link.


For beginners, a bank account saves money. Add a debit card for instant buys if needed.
Verify your payment method:
Bank: Log in to your bank after 1–2 days, find two small deposits (e.g., $0.12 and $0.15), and enter them in Coinbase.
Card/PayPal: Follow prompts to confirm (e.g., enter a code or log in).




Secure Your Account:
Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to protect your account:
Go to “Settings” > “Security” > “Two-Factor Authentication.”
Choose:
Authenticator App (recommended, e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy):
Download Google Authenticator from the App Store/Google Play.
Scan the QR code in Coinbase with the app.
Save the 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds.


Text Message (SMS): Enter your phone number, receive a code via text.


Every login requires your password + 2FA code.
Save your authenticator backup code (shown during setup) in a safe place.


Add a phone number for account recovery:
Go to “Settings” > “Security” > “Phone Number.”
Enter your number, verify with a text code.


Never share your password, 2FA codes, or backup codes. Coinbase won’t ask for them via email, phone, or X.



Step 3: Buy Your First Crypto

Choose a Cryptocurrency:
Open the app, tap “Trade” or “Buy/Sell” (bottom menu).
See a list of cryptocurrencies. For beginners:
Bitcoin (BTC): Most trusted, like a long-term investment.
Ethereum (ETH): Growing fast, used for DeFi (more later).
USDC: Stable at $1, great for practice.


Tap a coin to see its price chart and details (e.g., “Bitcoin: $60,000”).


Enter $10:
Select your crypto (e.g., Bitcoin).
Tap “Buy,” then type “$10” in the amount field.
Coinbase shows how much crypto you’ll get (e.g., 0.00016 BTC at $60,000/BTC).
Fees: For $10, expect $0.99–$2.99 (shown clearly). Fees drop for larger buys (e.g., 1.5% for $100+).


Select Payment Method:
Choose your linked bank, debit card, or PayPal.
Bank: Ensure funds are available. First-time deposits may take 3–5 days.
Card: Instant, but higher fees. Check your card’s daily limit.


Review and Confirm:
Check the breakdown: $10 (crypto) + $1.50 (fee) = $11.50 total.
Tap “Preview Buy” to see details.
If correct, tap “Buy Now.”
If using a bank, you’ll see “Order Submitted” (crypto arrives after funds clear).
For cards, crypto appears instantly.


Check Your Purchase:
Go to “Assets” or “Portfolio” to see your crypto (e.g., “Bitcoin: $10.00”).
Tap the coin to view transaction history (date, amount, price).



Step 4: Keep Your Crypto Safe

Coinbase Security:
Coinbase stores most crypto in “cold storage” (offline, like a vault).
They use encryption, 2FA, and insurance against hacks (rare).
Your account is safe if you use 2FA and avoid sharing login info.


Safety Practices:
Phishing: Never click links in emails claiming to be Coinbase. Always open the app or type www.coinbase.com manually.
Scams: If someone calls/messages about your Coinbase account, it’s a scam. Contact support only via the app.
Privacy: Don’t tell strangers you own crypto to avoid targeting.
Log Out: On shared devices, log out after each session (“Settings” > “Sign Out”).


Backup Your Account:
Save your password, 2FA setup, and phone number in a secure place (e.g., a locked notebook or password manager).
If you lose access, Coinbase can recover your account with ID verification.
Go to “Settings” > “Recovery” to set up account recovery options.



Step 5: Master Coinbase’s Built-In Features
Coinbase offers tools to make crypto easy. Here’s a detailed guide to each:

Buy and Sell Crypto:

Buying: Repeat Step 3 anytime to add more crypto.
Selling:
Go to “Trade” > “Sell.”
Select your crypto (e.g., Bitcoin).
Enter $10 (or “Sell All”).
Choose your bank or PayPal to receive funds.
Review fees (e.g., $0.99–$2.99) and tap “Sell Now.”
Funds arrive in 1–5 days (bank) or instantly (PayPal).


Converting: Swap one crypto for another (e.g., Bitcoin to Ethereum):
Go to “Trade” > “Convert.”
Select “From” (Bitcoin) and “To” (Ethereum).
Enter $10, review fees, and confirm.
No bank withdrawal needed—crypto stays in your account.




Portfolio Tracking:

Under “Assets” or “Portfolio,” see all your crypto.

Tap a coin for:
Price charts (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, all time).
Historical prices (e.g., Bitcoin was $30,000 last year).
Your holdings (e.g., 0.00016 BTC = $10).


Sort by value, percentage change, or name.


Price Alerts:

Get notified when prices hit your target.
Steps:
Go to a coin’s page (e.g., Bitcoin).
Tap the bell icon or “Set Alert.”
Choose “Price Above” (e.g., $70,000) or “Price Below” (e.g., $50,000).
Set frequency (once, every time, daily).
Tap “Save Alert.”


Notifications appear on your phone (enable push notifications in “Settings” > “Notifications”).
Edit/delete alerts in “Settings” > “Price Alerts.”


Recurring Buys:

Automate investing (like a savings plan).
Steps:
Go to “Trade” > “Recurring Buy” or tap “Schedule” on a coin’s page.
Select your crypto (e.g., Ethereum).
Enter $10 (or any amount).
Choose frequency: daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly.
Select payment method (bank is cheapest).
Set start date (e.g., today or next week).
Review: $10/week = $520/year.
Tap “Set Recurring Buy.”


View/edit in “Settings” > “Recurring Transactions.”
Cancel anytime (no penalty).
Why? Builds your investment without timing the market.


Send and Receive Crypto:

Send:
Go to “Assets,” select your crypto, tap “Send.”
Enter amount (e.g., $5 of Bitcoin).
Input recipient’s address (a long string, e.g., “1A1zP1eP5QGefi2D…”):
Copy/paste from their wallet/app.
Or scan their QR code (tap the scanner icon).


Double-check the address—wrong addresses lose funds!
Add a note (optional, e.g., “Birthday gift”).
Review network fee (e.g., $0.50 for Bitcoin).
Tap “Send Now.”
Takes 1–30 minutes to arrive (depends on the coin).


Receive:
Go to “Assets,” select a coin, tap “Receive.”
Copy your address or show the QR code.
Share with the sender (via text, email, etc.).
Funds appear in “Assets” when received.


Coinbase Users: Send to another Coinbase user’s email or username for free (no network fee).
Test Send: Try sending $1 first to confirm the address.


Coinbase Learn:

Earn free crypto by learning.
Steps:
Go to “Learn” in the app or www.coinbase.com/learn.
Browse lessons (e.g., “What is Bitcoin?” or “Intro to Polygon”).
Watch 1–2 minute videos or answer quiz questions (e.g., “What is a blockchain? A) Digital ledger”).
Earn $1–$5 per task (e.g., 0.01 ETH or 10 Stellar XLM).
Crypto is added to “Assets” instantly.


Tips:
Complete all available lessons (new ones added monthly).
Learn about new coins to understand your rewards.
Check “Assets” to see your earned crypto.




News and Market Updates:

The “Home” tab shows crypto news (e.g., “Ethereum upgrades network”).
Tap articles for details from trusted sources.
View market trends (top gainers/losers, price changes).
Follow Coinbase on X (@Coinbase) for real-time updates.


Customer Support:

Need help? Go to “Settings” > “Help” or www.coinbase.com/support.
Options:
Chat: Live support 24/7 (wait time: 1–10 minutes).
Email: Submit a ticket for complex issues.
FAQs: Search for answers (e.g., “Why is my bank deposit delayed?”).


Common issues:
Forgot password: Reset via email.
ID verification failed: Retake photos or contact support.
Payment issues: Check bank/card limits or relink.




Tax Reporting:

Crypto trades may be taxable (like selling stocks).
Coinbase simplifies taxes:
Go to “Taxes” in the app or website.
View your transaction history (buys, sells, sends).
Download a CSV or PDF report for your accountant.
Or connect to tax software (e.g., TurboTax, CoinTracker).


For $10 trades, taxes are minimal (e.g., report profits if you sell for $12).
Keep records of all trades for IRS compliance.
Consult a tax professional for advice.


Advanced Trading (Optional):

Coinbase’s “Advanced Trade” offers lower fees and pro tools (charts, limit orders).
Steps:
Go to “Trade” > “Advanced Trade” or download the Coinbase Pro app.
View live order books (buy/sell prices).
Place limit orders (e.g., “Buy Bitcoin at $50,000”).
Fees: 0.4–0.6% vs. 1.5–4% in the main app.


Why? Saves money for frequent traders.
For beginners: Stick to the main app—it’s simpler.



Step 6: Why Start with $10?

Low Risk: If prices drop, you lose little.
Hands-On Learning: Practice buying, selling, and tracking.
Growth Potential: If Ethereum rises 10%, $10 becomes $11.
Confidence: Master Coinbase before investing more.


Part 4: Setting Up and Managing a Coinbase Wallet
A Coinbase Wallet is a separate app for advanced control over your crypto. It’s still beginner-friendly and required for DeFi (like Uniswap). Here’s a detailed guide:
Why Use a Coinbase Wallet?

Ownership: You control your crypto, not Coinbase (like cash in your own safe).
DeFi Access: Connect to apps like Uniswap, Aave, or OpenSea.
Security: Your crypto is protected by a private key (more below).
Flexibility: Store any crypto, even coins not on Coinbase.

Step-by-Step Setup

Download the App:
Search “Coinbase Wallet” in the App Store or Google Play (purple logo with a shield, not the blue Coinbase app).
Install and open.


Create a Wallet:
Tap “Create a New Wallet” (not “Sign in with Coinbase”).
Set a username (optional, e.g., “CryptoBeginner123”). Used for sending crypto within Coinbase Wallet.
Choose a PIN (6 digits) or enable Face ID/Touch ID.
Agree to terms and tap “Continue.”


Save Your Recovery Phrase:
The wallet generates a 12-word recovery phrase (e.g., “cat apple moon star…”).
Critical: This phrase is your master key. If you lose your phone or PIN, it recovers your wallet. If someone gets it, they can steal your crypto.
Steps:
Write the 12 words on paper in order.
Store in a safe place (e.g., locked drawer, safe deposit box).
Never save digitally (no emails, texts, photos, or cloud storage).
Optional: Make a second copy and store separately (e.g., with a trusted family member).


Verify the phrase:
The app asks you to re-enter a few words (e.g., word #3 and #7).
If correct, your wallet is created.


Lost phrase? No recovery possible—your crypto is gone.


Explore the Wallet:
See “Assets” (empty until you add crypto).
View “Activity” for transactions (none yet).
Tap the browser icon (globe) for DeFi apps (later).


Fund Your Wallet:
Transfer crypto from your Coinbase app to your wallet.
Steps:
Get Wallet Address:
In Coinbase Wallet, tap “Receive.”
Select your crypto (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
Copy the address (e.g., “0x123aBc…” for ETH) or show the QR code.


Send from Coinbase:
In Coinbase app, go to “Assets,” select your crypto (e.g., $10 of ETH).
Tap “Send,” choose “Other Wallet.”
Paste your Coinbase Wallet address or scan the QR code.
Enter $10, review network fee (e.g., $0.50–$2 for ETH).
Tap “Send Now.”


Wait 1–10 minutes (check “Assets” in Coinbase Wallet).


Test Transfer: Send $1 first to confirm the address.
Supported Coins: Send BTC, ETH, USDC, or any coin in your Coinbase account.


Manage Your Wallet:
View Balances: See all crypto under “Assets” (e.g., “Ethereum: $10”).
Send Crypto:
Tap “Send,” select a coin, enter amount.
Paste recipient’s address or scan QR code.
Confirm network fee and send.


Receive Crypto:
Tap “Receive,” share your address/QR code.
Supports multiple coins (each has a unique address).


Switch Networks:
Coinbase Wallet supports multiple blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain).
Tap the network icon (top left) to switch (default: Ethereum).
For Uniswap, stay on Ethereum Mainnet.


Backup Reminder:
Go to “Settings” > “Security” to view your recovery phrase again (requires PIN/Face ID).
Test recovery by installing Coinbase Wallet on another device and entering your phrase.


Update App:
Keep Coinbase Wallet updated (check App Store/Google Play) for security and new features.





Wallet Safety Tips

Recovery Phrase:
Never share with anyone, even Coinbase support.
Store offline (paper, metal backup like Billfodl).
If lost, your crypto is unrecoverable.


Scams:
Fake apps mimic Coinbase Wallet. Download only from official stores.
Ignore X DMs asking for your phrase.


Test Transactions: Always send small amounts first.
PIN/Face ID: Don’t share your PIN. Reset via recovery phrase if forgotten.
Backup Copies: Store phrase in multiple safe locations.
Lost Phone: Install Coinbase Wallet on a new device, enter your recovery phrase, and your crypto is back.


Part 5: Using Uniswap (DeFi for Beginners)
What Is DeFi?
DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is like online banking without banks. You use apps to trade, lend, or earn interest on crypto. Uniswap is a DeFi app where you swap one crypto for another (e.g., ETH for USDC). It’s advanced, so we’ll break it down carefully.
Why Try Uniswap?

Access thousands of coins not on Coinbase (e.g., UNI, AAVE, or new tokens).
Learn cutting-edge crypto with small amounts ($10–$20).
Take control of your investments.

Prerequisites

Coinbase Wallet with $15–$30 in ETH (for swaps + gas fees).
Comfort with Coinbase Wallet (from Part 4).
Willingness to learn new terms (gas, slippage, liquidity).

Step-by-Step Guide to Uniswap

Fund Your Coinbase Wallet:
Ensure $15–$30 in ETH (e.g., $10 for swapping, $5–$20 for gas fees).
Transfer from Coinbase app (see Part 4, Step 5).
Check “Assets” in Coinbase Wallet to confirm ETH balance.


Access Uniswap:
Open Coinbase Wallet, tap the browser icon (globe).
Type “app.uniswap.org” and press enter.
Verify you’re on the official site (check URL, look for “Uniswap Interface”).
If the site doesn’t load, try again or clear browser cache in “Settings” > “Browser.”


Connect Your Wallet:
On Uniswap, tap “Connect Wallet” (top right).
Select “Coinbase Wallet” from the list.
Approve the connection in Coinbase Wallet (tap “Connect”).
Uniswap now links to your wallet’s ETH balance.


Set Up a Swap:
On Uniswap’s “Swap” page:
From: Select ETH (your starting coin).
To: Choose a coin to receive (e.g., USDC, a stablecoin worth $1).
Search for coins by name or address (stick to trusted ones like USDC, DAI, UNI).


Enter amount: Type “$10” or “0.002 ETH” (based on ETH’s price, e.g., $5,000/ETH).
Uniswap shows:
Amount received (e.g., 10 USDC).
Gas fee (e.g., $2–$10, paid in ETH).
Slippage (price change during the swap, default: 0.5%).




Adjust Swap Settings:
Tap the gear icon for advanced options:
Slippage Tolerance: Set to 0.5–1% (protects against price changes). Higher for volatile coins (2–3%), but riskier.
Transaction Deadline: Default 20 minutes (swap cancels if it takes longer).
Gas Price: Choose “Medium” (balanced speed/cost). “Fast” costs more, “Slow” may fail.


For beginners: Keep defaults unless gas fees are high.


Preview and Confirm Swap:
Tap “Swap” to review:
From: 0.002 ETH ($10).
To: 10 USDC.
Fees: $3 (gas) + 0.3% Uniswap fee.
Minimum received (after slippage).


If correct, tap “Confirm Swap.”
In Coinbase Wallet, review the transaction:
Check gas fee (e.g., 0.0006 ETH = $3).
Tap “Confirm” (uses your PIN/Face ID).


Wait 1–5 minutes (track in Coinbase Wallet’s “Activity”).


Check Your Swap:
In Coinbase Wallet, go to “Assets” to see your new coin (e.g., 10 USDC).
View transaction details in “Activity” (shows ETH spent, USDC received).
If the swap fails (e.g., high slippage), you pay gas but keep your ETH. Try again with higher slippage (1–2%).


Manage Your New Coin:
Hold in Coinbase Wallet (safe long-term).
Swap back to ETH on Uniswap (repeat steps, select USDC > ETH).
Send to Coinbase app:
In Coinbase Wallet, tap “Send,” select USDC.
Copy your Coinbase app’s USDC address (“Assets” > USDC > “Receive”).
Send $10, pay a small gas fee ($1–$5).




Monitor Gas Fees:
Gas fees vary by Ethereum network traffic:
Low: $1–$5 (weekends, late nights).
High: $10–$50 (busy weekdays).


Check fees on etherscan.io or in Uniswap’s preview.
If fees exceed $10, wait 1–2 hours or swap less ($5).
Use “Slow” gas for non-urgent swaps to save money.


Explore Uniswap Features:
Liquidity Pools: Advanced users can provide crypto to earn fees (risky, skip for now).
Analytics: View coin prices/charts on Uniswap’s “Analytics” tab.
Tokens: Search for new coins, but research first (see below).



Uniswap Safety Tips

Trusted Coins:
Stick to established tokens: USDC, DAI, UNI, AAVE.
Avoid new coins promising “100x gains”—many are scams.
Check coin details on www.coingecko.com or www.coinmarketcap.com (market cap, volume, reviews).


Official Site:
Only use app.uniswap.org. Fake sites steal wallets.
Bookmark the URL in Coinbase Wallet’s browser.


Gas Fees:
Always review fees before confirming.
If fees are high, reduce swap amount or wait.
Track gas trends on ethgasstation.info.


Slippage:
Set 0.5–1% for stablecoins, 1–3% for volatile coins.
Too low: Swap fails. Too high: You lose value.


Scams:
Ignore X DMs about Uniswap or new tokens.
Never share your recovery phrase or approve unknown apps.


Research:
Read about coins on Coinbase Learn, Uniswap’s blog, or trusted sites.
Check Twitter/X for community sentiment (@Uniswap, @CoinGecko).


Test Swaps:
Start with $5–$10 to learn.
Practice with USDC (no price risk).



DeFi Risks

No Support: Unlike Coinbase, Uniswap has no customer service. Mistakes (wrong address, failed swaps) lose money.
Volatility: New coins can drop to $0.
Smart Contract Bugs: Rare, but DeFi apps can have flaws.
Impermanent Loss: Avoid liquidity pools until you’re advanced.
Scams: Fake tokens or rug pulls (creators steal funds).
Gas Costs: Fees can exceed your swap amount.

Alternative DeFi Apps (Optional)
Once comfortable with Uniswap, try:

Aave: Lend crypto to earn interest.
Connect Coinbase Wallet to app.aave.com.
Deposit $10 USDC, earn ~2–5% annual interest.
Research risks (e.g., platform hacks).


Compound: Similar to Aave, lend/borrow crypto.
OpenSea: Buy NFTs (digital art/collectibles).
Use Coinbase Wallet on opensea.io.
Start with $10 NFTs, check gas fees.


Steps are similar: Connect wallet, approve transactions, pay gas.


Part 6: Advanced Coinbase Features
For users ready to go beyond basics, Coinbase offers sophisticated tools. Here’s how to use them:

Limit Orders (Advanced Trade):

Buy/sell at a specific price.
Steps:
Go to “Trade” > “Advanced Trade” or use Coinbase Pro app.
Select a pair (e.g., BTC-USD).
Choose “Limit Order.”
Set price (e.g., “Buy Bitcoin at $50,000”).
Enter amount ($10).
Tap “Place Order.”
Order executes when the price hits $50,000.


Fees: 0.4–0.6% (lower than main app).

Confirm staking.
Rewards paid weekly/monthly (e.g., $0.50/year for $10).


Risks: Price drops, lockup periods (can’t sell staked crypto instantly).
Unstake anytime in “Assets” > “Staking.”


Coinbase Card:

A debit card that spends crypto.
Steps:

For tech-savvy users, automate trades with Coinbase’s API.
Steps:
Go to www.coinbase.com/developer-platform.
Create an API key in “Settings” > “API.”
Use in scripts (e.g., Python) to buy/sell programmatically.


Skip unless you code—high risk of errors.


Portfolio Diversification:

Spread your $10 across multiple coins.
Steps:
Buy $5 BTC, $3 ETH, $2 USDC.
Track in “Assets.”
Rebalance monthly (sell high, buy low).
